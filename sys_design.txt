Summary of game
You are a hacker who wants to steal documents from a computer.
The computer is currently locked and you need to solve the cipher before you can unlock it.
There is a countdown-timer for solving the cipher. If it goes to zero, you will be locked out permanently and lose.

/**
 * IDEAS
 *
 * Player can fill in text box below each char object.
 * They have an X amount of chances to check their answer.
 * - Incorrect text boxes will have a red border
 * - Correct text boxes will have a green border
 * - Unfilled text boxes will remain neutral coloured
 * If changes go to zero, they cannot check their answer anymore.
 * Once they click the SUBMIT button, they should have the correct decrypted key
 * or else the alarm will be triggered and they get caught.
 *
 * If text-input is too difficult, treat each char .png as an object.
 * The player may click on each char of the encrypted text, then press a keyboard
 * letter to enter in what they think is the decrypted char.
 * Once pressed, the game engine will render their choice directly below the
 * encrypted char.

/**
 * GAME IDEA
 *
 * Tug of war crypto challenge.
 *
 * Player fights a hacker by solving substitution cipher.

/**
 * CHAR RENDERING IDEA
 *
 * Create a series of rectangular boxes first, to represent where each A-Z image object will be placed
 * As the player clicks into each box, they can press a key to insert A-Z image object into the rectangular box.
